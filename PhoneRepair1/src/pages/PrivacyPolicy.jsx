          CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
          websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach
          stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in
          the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites
          collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
          consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating
          exactly the information being collected and those individuals or
          companies with whom it is being shared. – See more{" "}

          When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
          under the age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy
          Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade
          Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the
          COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online
          services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online. We
          do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

        <p className="text-sm leading-6 tracking-wider text-thm_secondary_color">
          The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
          law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
          significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
          globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how
          they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
          privacy laws that protect personal information.

        <h5 className="text-xl tracking-littelwider">
          In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take

          We will notify you via email • Within 7 business days We also agree to
          the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have
          the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors
          and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires
          not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users,
          but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government
          agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data
          processors.
